"""
Today I Learned (TIL) Journal

Purpose:
This simple Python program helps you keep track of what you learn every day.
You can add a new note for today or view all your past notes, which are saved
locally in a file called 'entries.json'. Itâ€™s a neat little way to build a daily
learning habit and look back on your progress over time.
